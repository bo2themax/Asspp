- Or [Open in SideStore](sidestore://source?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakr233/Asspp/refs/heads/main/sidestore.json)

### Troubleshooting

- This installation method does not register the software with the App Store, so it cannot auto-update. Manual updates can retain data, but subsequent installations cannot use this software, and this method cannot overwrite existing apps.
